# 🧠 LeetCode Daily Journey 🚀

Hi I'm Haswanth, and this repo is a daily record of my LeetCode practice. I'm solving problems consistently to improve my data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving skills.

Each folder contains the topic name, problem name, and my solution in Java. I aim to push myself with harder problems over time and track my consistency.
